    "1. The ```Teams``` table contains information about teams and their seasons. Interesting columns are:\n",
    "    - ```teamID```\n",
    "    - ```franchID```\n",
    "    - ```name```\n",

    "1. The ```Parks``` table contains information about park names, their cities and states.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "1. JOINing ```Teams``` and ```Parks``` should enable finding teams that played in cities, except the ```Teams``` table and ```Parks``` table sometimes have slightly different names for the park/stadium. This requires matching instead equality.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "1. Write a query that returns the ```teamID, franchID, team name, park.name``` from ```Parks``` for all teams that played in Boston.\n",
